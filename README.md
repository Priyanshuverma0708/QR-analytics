## QR Analytics

QR Analytics is a Node.js-based backend platform that tracks QR code scans and provides valuable analytics such as timestamp, location, and scan frequency. It's designed for businesses and developers who want insights into how their QR codes are being used.

##  Features

-  Geolocation Tracking using LocationIQ
-  Timestamp Logging
-  Scan Statistics API (total scans, scans by city/state, etc.)
-  Rate Limiting to prevent abuse
-  Modular and Scalable Codebase
-  MongoDB integration for scan data storage
